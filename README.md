# DynamicWeatherEffects
This Is The Plugin Source Code Repo For What Will Be The FrameWork For The Dynamic Weather Effects Mod I'm Working On. <br/>
I Hope To Extend This Much Further Beyond That Project In The Future, But First Thing's First, Get This Up And Running For That Mod! <br/>

## Building ##
To Build, You'll First Need:
- CommonLibSSE's Dependencies
    - span-lite
    - spdlog 
</br>

### Optional Dependencies: ###
- For Static Analysis Checks (You'll Need To Set The Env Path If You Use These):
    - cppcheck
    - clang-tidy
    - include-what-you-use
    - ccache

### Generating Project Files ###
- Run  ```"git clone https://github.com/USAFrenzy/DynamicWeatherEffects-Framework.git"```
- Now ```cd DynamicWeatherEffects-Framework```
- Run  ```"cmake -B build[Or Other Output Destination] -S ."```
    - The Submodule Update Commands ```git submodule update --init --recursive``` </br> 
      and ```git submodule update --recursive --remote``` Are Included In The </br>
      cmake Build Process So No Need To Worry About These
- Project Options Can Be Changed In ```cmake/ProjectOptions.cmake```
- Project Settings Can Be Changed In ```cmake/ProjectSettings.cmake```
- Compiler Options Can Be Changed In ```cmake/CompilerWarnings.cmake```
- The Default Settings Should Be All You Need, But Feel Free To Change Them
- If You Build The Project, These Can Always Be Changed Via The cache File <br/>
  Generated By cmake, Or By Easily Using ccache If You Opted For That Option

### Building The DLL ###
- Open Your IDE Of Choice Used To Generate The Project Files
- Click On The ```Solution``` Tab And Hit ```Build```
- Or Just Build Individually By Clicking On ```CommonLibSSE``` And ```Build``` And Then Clicking On ```DynamicWeatherEffects``` And ```Build```
    - Building ```DynamicWeatherEffects``` Should Build ```CommonLibSSE``` Anyways As It Relies On That Library

Done! That's All You Need To Do! <br/>
